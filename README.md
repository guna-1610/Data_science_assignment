# Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Dataset

This repository contains the solutions for the Data Science Assignment focused on analyzing eCommerce transaction data.

## Project Overview

The assignment consists of three tasks:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights**
   - Perform EDA on the provided dataset and derive actionable business insights.
2. **Lookalike Model**
   - Build a recommendation model to find similar customers based on their profiles and transaction history.
3. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**
   - Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.

## File Structure

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- `EDA_Task1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for EDA.
- `EDA_Insights_Report.pdf`: PDF report summarizing the business insights.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- `Lookalike_Task2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the Lookalike Model.
- `Lookalike_Model_Results.csv`: CSV file with top 3 similar customers for the first 20 customers.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
- `Clustering_Task3.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for clustering.
- `Clustering_Results.pdf`: PDF report summarizing clustering results.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook):
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Run the notebooks to reproduce the results.

## Dataset

The datasets used in this assignment are:
- `Customers.csv`: Contains customer profiles.
- `Products.csv`: Contains product information.
- `Transactions.csv`: Contains transaction data.

## Results

### Task 1: EDA
- Insights derived from the dataset include:
  - Customer distribution by region.
  - Top-performing product categories.
  - Revenue trends over time.
  - Average customer lifetime value.

### Task 2: Lookalike Model
- A recommendation model was developed to find the top 3 similar customers for each user based on their profiles and transaction history.

### Task 3: Customer Segmentation
- Optimal number of clusters determined using Davies-Bouldin Index.
- Segments customers based on spending patterns and transaction history.
